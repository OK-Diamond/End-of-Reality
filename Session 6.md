Bog decided to sleep on a pile of gold and gets a long rest. Then replicates a bag of holding and puts all the gold into it.
Bog tries to leave but goes into another poker room. There is a cleaner that tells bog that he has to go up 5 floors to leave. 
Bog makes it back to the street and truest to navigate to the tavern where we all drunk. On the outside, it is obvious it is a sewer. 
Bog is right by the tavern, he can see the door. 
Dwarf says Bog’s friends are looking for him in the jails. Bog leaves towards the prison as well. 
Ayltan has no clue how to get out. Tries breaking the chains with the knife handle, fails, the handle is in 2. Then tries with the handle and fails again. Asks the box, the box insults him.
Ayltan takes clothes off of the body and tries to make a rope, fails with the tunic. Fails with the trousers. Makes a ball from clothes and throws it to get the box closer but pushes the box further away. 
Ayltan tries to use the body to scoop the box near him, fails again. 
Valdoris tries to run away and uses a spell, starts combat, tries to run and is downed. 
Mivo and the rogue in prison are trying to break out. Mivo pretends to hit the rogue. A guard comes and Mivo casts suggestion on the guard to tell people they should leave. It works and the guard starts ordering people to leave. 
Meehan tries to run away from the guards. Succeeds but gets lost in exchange.
Bog, Mivo and rogue reunite in the tavern and bog says he didn’t see the other 2. Mivo asks Bog about what’s in the bag of holding but Bog does not want to tell them he has gold inside the bag. 
Bog remembers someone swam in the river and he hopes they didn’t go to the bottom of the river. 
Mivo and Horgor asks where the person Swam through the river. Mivo says they should not talk to the guards after they broke out of jail. Horgor pretends he did nothing like that.
Ayltan decided to break all of his bones in his ankle and foot to break out of the chain. Passes out from the pain, comes back with 1 hp after a nag 20 on death save. 
Crawls to grab the box and starts thinking of how he is going to escape. 
Veldoris wakes up on a table, with a foot in his face and asked for explanations. Veldoris says he was absolutely drunk. 
He is asked who he is and says he’s a traveller named Veldoris and has only been here a day. 
Anytime Veldoris mentions being drunk, the person twitches and flinches. He is asked where he hails from and he says he doesn’t know. The underdark. The figure is the prince. 
Valdoris says we can serve the military for the prince. As his companions are much more capable of things. The prince says “say ah” and as soon as Veldoris does, he stabs his rapier through his mouth and put the back of his neck. First character death.
Meehan hears Ayltan’s voice in the cellar. Looking down, he sees a tiny sliver where the street does not meet the building.
Ayltan tells Meehan he’s inside there with a box. A broken foot and a living box. 
Meehan slams into the window trying to break it and bounces off. A hooded figure opens the door and misses with a light crossbow. Meehan makes a chaos bolt attack. 
Meehan fucking kills his target in the doorway. 
Meehan looses the fight and falls through the trapdoor. Ayltan takes stuff off of his body to try to escape. 
The others are trying to get across the river. Mivo wants to convince the guards to tell them about a drunken friend. 
Mivo goes to ask the guard and the guard says the body would have washed up. They go to the docks and find a building where bodies might wash up. 
A peg legged person with a missing eye, ear and other random bits opens the door and points towards the body of Veldoris is in the table. 6 bodies washed up last night. 
Bog thinks Valdoris is sleeping, while the others see the stab wound on his body and they can’t tell if he died from drowning or from the stab wound. The man says he washed up early last night. 
Bog pulls a wand with Ruby of the Warmage from his bag of holding and casts detect magic. Valdoris died not magically. 
They tied rocks to Valdoris’ ankles and put him in the sea. He soon floated up to the surface and floated away.
Ayltan ties Meehan’s shovel, quarterstaff and torch to break open the trapdoor. Fails 7 times so 7 torches are used. Then throws a rope around the open door. The guards are scared away by a piece of clothing tied to the torch. 
Ayltan throws a rope around the open trapdoor and then fails like 15 times to either climb to the top, open the trapdoor from the top or not fall off. Takes a bunch of damage while falling off. Then fails again and falls back down, downed, but stable. (After 2 failed and 2 succeeded death saves) 
The other 3 are looking for people. Bog points them to a building. There is an old fella with feet up sitting in the room, staring at trapdoor in the room. 
Horgor snacks the back of his dagger into his head. Then tie him up. Upon opening the trapdoor, there is a 40 year old bard, and another female bard. 
All of the bodies have a plain black ring. Bog jumps down into the trapdoor and slaps the two people. They are essentially see through.
Horgor finds Ayltan and Meehan in a different room. 
Jamie’s new character, the cleric, wakes up in a cupboard and knocks on the door. Horgor hears this and opens the cupboard. 
Derrick is a human with a buzz cut. 6 ft 1”, chain mail on. Sounds like Jamie. The others ask a lot of questions. Derrick says he is able to heal. They let him out of the cupboard. 
There is a scream coming from the other room where bog is. Looks like a father and daughter in a corner while bog is advancing towards them with his hand. 
Mivo is threatening to heat metal on Derrick unless he heals Ayltan in the ditch. 
Derrick climbs down and heals Ayltan and Meehan.
