- Horgor ties her up. Tells Ayltan to stay here with her. 
- Horgor, Bog and Meeham go to a different room to discuss what to say to to Hex. 
- Darrell tries to bite Hex, Ayltan stands between them, Mivo restrains Darell. 
- Horgor comes back in, bringing all the others with him. Mivo ungags Hex. 
- Hex says Darrell knows everything and we try to figure out what it was about. 
- Darrell says he knows what she meant when she said it was something recent. 
- Ayltan asked if she knows Aurelia, she looks scared and asks why. 
- Hex says Aurelia as in Princess Aurelia Malcolm, the duke’s (of Korgos) daughter. 
- “A warm wind rises in the east” is one half of the phrase. You are meant to respond with another half. 
- Darrell starts waterboarding Hex, with Mivo’s help. Ayltan and Horgor stop them. 
- We all go to sleep but Horgor and Mivo are in the room with her. 
- She breaks out during the night and gets to a point where she is literally sobbing. She spent all night like this. 
- We wake up in the morning, Ayltan releases Hex and we go to meet Aurelia’s employer. 
- Some major tomfoolery occurs and our employer ends up decapitated by Horgor. 
- We are surrounded by 3 groups with crossbows aimed at us. They are not all together and one group shoots a member of another group. 
- The third group is the best and quickly demolishes the others. 
- We all run besides Darrell who decides to jump in a tree as a cat where he gets surrounded by the third group. 
- As Horgor runs away he says “the tree that falls alone falls silently”. 
- We all run away and the tree that Darrell jumped into is surrounded by group 3. They start pouring alcohol around the tree. 
- Bog disguises self into Darrell but his kobold body is kept the same shape, and tries to mimic Darrell’s voice as best as he can. 
- The ruse doesn’t work and Darrell eventually gets captured by 1 person from group 3. We get surrounded by the other 4. Horgor keeps on trying to kill Darrell.
- Darrell gets captured and we all escape, being downed a few times. The party vs Ayltan have an argument of morals, Ayltan trying his absolute best to convince them to save Darrell.
- Darrell wakes up in a dark room, a voice echoing around him welcomes him. Asks if he wants anything, he asks for food. The food is good. 
- Asks why he’s here and the person says it’s the same reason everyone was chasing him, and he asks who the voice is. 
- The voice asks him how she is getting out. Darrell says there is a staircase in the inner wall. She took him in there. 
- Says the people we were with were assumed evil by Aurelia. 
- Darrell says there was one called spurt, another one called Anna when prompted by the voice. 
- Someone else is heard in the background, bickering with the voice. 
- The voice asks where the walk stairs are. 
- Another voice takes over the microphone and gets excited about church of Lathander when Darrell mentioned the stairs are near the church of Lathander. 
- The excited voice says she watched Darrell’s god die. Savarnus. 
- The original voice comes back and Darrell says the god died, the voice confirms that Savarnas was killed by Gawyn. 
- Gawyn is dead, Neif is alive but Darrell won’t be killing her. Eric is dead. Aphelia is dead. Chiron and Amylin are alive and the voice permits Darrel to kill them. Will is dead. 
- The voice feels like there is somebody else. 
- The excited voice is Neif. Darrell asks to speak to her but the voice tells Neif to shush. 
- Darrell says he told a guard guy but he is dead. Sir pentamous. Voice asks if he told anyone else. 
- Guy at bar but Darrell watched him die. Told Hex, voice says he will be murdered next. 
- Names Bog, Mivo, Horgor, Meeham, Ayltan. All of these were confirmed to be killed by the voice. 
- The voice liked Hex so she does not want to kill her. 
- Darrell asks if he is going to die as well and the voice assured him he will not. 
- After all this, the voice asks Darrell how he would like to die. He says “I’m 50 years and of old age”. 
- He says he will not tell anyone, so she can let him go. Voice says that’s a fucking lie as he just told her everything. 
- Darrell says he is more scared of the voice and the fact that Neif is there. Neif jumps on the mic and starts fangirling over Lathander again. 
- Neif says her father used to run her church. She has 7 kids, 8 kids, 7 kids. She doesn’t see much of them.
- The voice comes back and says that a brilliant way for Darrell to go would be “poetic justice”. 
- A sheet of paper blows into Ayltan’s face. He cannot read so he gives it to Meeham. 
- It reads “Hello incompetent group. Your great friend Darrell has marked you all for execution. As I do not know what to do with him, as he is also marked for execution, I will just leave him in your care.”
