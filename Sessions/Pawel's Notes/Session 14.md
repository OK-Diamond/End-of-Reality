We fuck around and look for Darrell, find a crazy old cat lady saying “here kitty kitty kitty” while hitting her rolling pin against her pan. 
She sniffs the air around her at various intervals, all while ignoring us totally and fully. 
Ayltan grabs her occasionally and she is really easy to apprehend. 
She leads us to a house, COVERED in rot and mould. She gets a key and goes outside. 
Leads us to a trapdoor which the key opens. Darrel is inside being interrogated by Sir Pentious.
A 9 ft talk barbarian with a massive battle axe named Ogg starts attacking Darrell. 
Combat happens. 
There is a wizard woman named Hex as well. Ayltan casts some protection for Darrell and then does nothing the entire combat. 
Mivo gets downed, Meeham gets downed, Horgor gets downed and Ayltan gets downed. Then Darrell gets downed and fucking dies outright as the barbarian massacres his body. 
Darrell gets revivified after all that. 
He wakes up in a street surrounded by guards and a beer belly priest. One of the well-dressed guards leans in and whispers “a warm wind rises in the East” 
Darrell is clueless and decides to leave, sees Ogg dropping in sweat. Ogg then jumps back in the hole.
Horgor (Lisa) gets guards on the scene and explains the situation. Says Ogg killed Darrell and needs to be apprehended. 
The same guard leans in and says “A warm wind rises in the East” to Horgor and he says “not now, now is not a good time” 
Horgor tells them about Hex as well. 
Ayltan and Mivo run away and we find Meeham in a park. We then head to a tavern and find Hex there. 
We just tell her to get the fuck away, she is really sheepish. Eventually leaves. She is really confused. 
The priests heals Horgor and asks if he’s part of.. as well. Horgor says well now he is. 
The man says that this is where he was. Where he was operating. 
The man pulls Horgor aside and asks for any sign of her. 
He asked if she made it out. Horgor says he needs a catch up. The man says he found a way through the wall with little guards. 
He says he will sort this and then tells all the guards that they are done here. 
The guard says they cannot paint Sir Pentious as a bad fellow unless they have the key. And Horgor hands him the key that the lady had.
Ayltan apprehended the key off of her earlier. 
The other 2 join us in the tavern and join us in the shirt rest. There is a man on a table behind us who asks how we did it. He gestures the person to his right and she speaks in a voice that Darrell knows. 
They ask how we pretend we are so incompetent but still survive ridiculous things. She asks us if we want a job and to meet her at the park tomorrow. 
Ayltan is being Ayltan and he says he wants some cheese. Horgor says to get a glass of milk, he says he does not want that. Horgor says to get a glass of cheese instead. 
This turns out to be a fucking code name for like drugs or something. Ayltan and this barkeeper have a weird back-and-forth of Ayltan explaining he wants some cheese in a glass and the guy saying yes he gets that, so what does he want. 
Horgor steps in and apologises for Ayltan and fucking orders some drugs. Pays 30lbs worth of gems to get it, gets handed a beer with a small bag underneath it. 
We all go to our rooms and Hex is right next to us, saying it’s fucking unbelievable. Horgor charges at her.
