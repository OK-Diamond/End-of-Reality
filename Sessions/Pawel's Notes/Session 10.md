<< [[Session 9]] | [[Session 11]] >>

---

- We fight, people keep doing down, tent is escaped. 
- Meanwhile Bog is shitting in a bush, the shit is a type 7 shit on the scientific scale, and it contains the ring which has been washed off. 
- Derrick fucking dies but we all escape. 
- We long rest by the town and plan to come back the next day. 
- On the third watch, Meehan and Mivo notice someone looking at us. Says he was gonna jump us, and gets his crossbow out. Mivo, Horgor and Meehan contest him. 
- Horgor fucking kills the guy. 
- Horgor finds a letter. It says “thank you for dealing with him. He’s been a pest.” In the same handwriting as the last one (Mary’s). 
- We head to the market, Horgor buys oil. Then Horgor and Meehan go to a drug store, buying hallucinogens. 
- We all wait until later and sneak towards the goblin village to scout it. The party is planning to incinerate the goblins. Ayltan says he’s not too keen on killing them in the most brutal way.
- As we sneak Ayltan is spotted and a goblin with a bomb approaches him, lighting the fuse.
- He is killed by Horgor. 
- Horgor sneaks ahead and sees that’s the village is all cooped up in the middle and that sneaking in for a bomb plant is not gonna work.
- Plan goes to shit, we get caught and Meehan is downed while running away. We head back.
- Meehan is being boiled alive but uses thaumaturgy and Mivo’s inspiration, to convince the goblins that there is a god punishing them.
- The goblins all scatter and the camp is in a panic. 
- We see an abandoned camp and a cooking Meehan.
