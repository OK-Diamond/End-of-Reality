Ayltan trusts Derrick a lot, Mivo doesn’t, we say we will get out.
In the other pit, Horgor asks the two if they want to get out and he helps them out. 
The Mafia group are clerics of syrich 
Derrick gets out easily. Ayltan falls one but then succeeds. Makes it to the top and then immediately is hit with all the pain. 
Meehan fails and then gets downed but then Mivo uses healing word. 
Meehan falls again. And then managed to get up. 
Derrick runs away from Bog after screaming like a little girl. Bog advances towards Derrick and Horgor tells him off. 
The couple has been down there for 3 months. They say there is no healer around here. 
Bog says he has a lot of gold and will cover Ayltan’s foot fixing. 
Someone knocks at the door and Mivo dresses up and goes to the door in the hood and the ring.
Someone is complaining about the racket we’re making and that we need to move our sex parties elsewhere. 
Horgor goes upstairs with Bog and there are 3 closed doors. Bog tries to open one of them. 
There is a room of 18 dead bodies, it’s one of the most grim things Bog has seen in his life. Horgor then watches Bog open the next one. 
Horgor opens the first one again while bog opens the second one. There are 34 bodies and both of them start retching. 
We all feel the smell. Bog opens the third do, no bodies, there is a room with claw marks and a person in the middle who is chained to the wall and snarls at bog. 
Horgor yells that there is a monster at which point the being says he’s not a monster. The being has many names. Introduces himself as Methsrov. 
Horgor and bog come back down as the lady is counting time until we leave. Mivo fucking smacks her with a hammer and misses, then tries again as Horgor throws Bog at her. 
The hammer smacks into his eye socket, as Bog feels his eye give in under pressure, as he passes out and looses and eye. 
The woman is screaming for guards and Meehan fucking burns a hole in her chest.
Derrick and Bog run out the front door as guards try to grapple Derrick, one of the guards hits a wall. 
18 guards come to the building and tell us to come out, weapons down. They apprehend us, I tell them about my leg and they kick me in it and I fall down. Horgor starts running away. 
The guards start beating me and Ayltan passes away. 
We are then dragged back to a jail. Mivo recognises it as the one he’s been in. There are a lot of onlookers.
Horgor lost the guards and then attempts to follow stealthily after Bog and Derrick. 
Horgor says he needs to heal Bog and starts threatening Derrick. Derrick says he shouldn’t be the one paying. Horgor says Derrick kidnapped him but Derrick says he saved Bog’s life. They then went to find a healer. 
They went to a temple of the god of protection, Helm. Derrick goes in and one of the healers rush Bog to a back room and put it on a table. 
Meehan, Mivo and Ayltan get thrown into the same cell Mivo was in earlier. Ayltan starts waking up. The guards start celebrating that they finally got us. 
Bog is healed but his vision is very off. Horgor speaks to the healer and the healer says you can’t walk around without getting mugged. 
Derrick says he woke up in a closet and only got out thanks to us. The healer asks what happened. Horgor says that Derrick has been drinking. Then they decide to all drink, to celebrate Bog. 
Syrich is the god of torture and pain and all this violence. The cults need to be stamped out, they’re a plague on the land. The healer says it’s the same as waking into a cult of Luls. 
The prison trio gets their short rests. We hear the guards talking quietly. 10 guards come walking down towards our cell. 
One unlocks our cell. And we are led down the street towards the gallows. The rest see us and Horgor wants to help us but the other 2 decide we cannot help them. 
We are at the gallows. Mivo casts suggestion on one of the guards to unlock all of our manacles. He gets Mivo’s off with a loud clang. Mivo dives towards the river but hits the platform. Ayltan does the same. 
We all see arrows flying around the square. They are fired by Horgor who climbed a building on the other side of the river.  
Ayltan dives towards the river but fails as well. 
Mivo dives into the river properly and is immediately seized by the currents as he tries to cross to the other side. 
Derrick starts praying on his knees to Lathander and begs for no lives to be taken. 
Meehan disengages and runs towards the river. He jumps straight into the river. He fails to swim and then takes a level of exhaustion. 
The guards start shooting at Meehan and Mivo. 
They cannot find Horgor. 
Bog is lost on the streets. 
Meehan and Mivo are both downed in the river from the shots. 
Ayltan is tackled into the river by a guard who starts drowning. Ayltan then floats down the river. 
The guards all yell where Horgor is and start shooting at him. Horgor falls off the building. 
Meehan and Mivo both die but 2 inspirations are used to put them both on 1 hp again. 
The guards all shoot at Derrick for stabilising Horgor. Both of them are now downed. 
Bog went to let out the monster. The monster says that he called Bog food and he let him out. Bog asks if it could help save his friends. 
The creature asks him what he desires the  most. Bog says he wants to turn back time half a day.
Creature says he can’t do that and Bog instead asks for something shiny. The creature writes “Something Shiny will be presented to “Bog” upon completion of this form. In return he will give xvfg his soul” 
Bog gets a REALLY shiny silver piece in exchange for the contract. Asks if he could help his friends and Bog disappears in a cloud of flames.
