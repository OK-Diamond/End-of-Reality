DM question: Who is Gawyn’s  first friends: Neif Almalda.
Mivo finds more people on the road camping. Many more bonfires in tents. Mivo goes to investigate and walks straight into a wall. He then realises that the people on the road are a painting, an imaculate, life-like painting. 
The painting is massive but the only thing that gives it away is that nothing is moving. Mivo attempts to break it but it is brick. The cut that he made is immediately repaired by the paint, as if it was never touched. 
The painting is seemingly infinite. There are sounds of scratching from inside the painting. Something is rubbing on something, but a sharper sound. 
Mivo says “hello” but hears no response, however movement catches his eye in the top right. Something is disappearing from the painting, in strokes as if by an eraser. 
We all got woken up. Mivo illuminates the painting and we all see it. Horgor goes to see if there is one on the other side.
Meehan draws things on the painting and writes on it, killing people. The people are then erased. 
Derrick burns the painting, Meehan draws water clouds which floods the painting, people drown and a lot of damage is done.
The painting does have a ceiling which we discovered through shooting a fire bolt upwards. Mivo puts dancing lights high up in the painting and touches the surface. All the people start staring at the point where it touched. 
We go into a combat as Derrick is killing the painting people. Eventually that is resolved.
Meehan erased a massive white square of paint across the painting, revealing chipboard. The hole creates a vacuum that sucks all the contents of the painting inside itself. 
The painting became a wasteland, everything has suddenly disappeared, not many people are left. 
A lot is being erased and redrawn again. 
Horgor writes with a pen on the painting. “Hello world” and the painting responds “hello”.
The person is called Gawyn. Horgor asks if he knows us and he says no. He can vaguely see us. 
We are there to stop his erasing us from existence. This is sort of a Demi-plane. 
Gawyn knows Mary. He is currently with her mother. 
Gawyn does not want Bog to write to him. He says let me do this. 
Gawyn knows Asmodeus. Horgor says we talked to him and Gawyn just says “?”. 
The painting stopped moving and is now a new still-Frame. 
Everything suddenly appears in front of us that was in the painting. 
A person from the painting talks to us, we traumatise them like always, then Gawyn says he made a mistake and erased the person. 
Other painting NPCs come to investigate. 
 We arrive in Banner and see the person get hung. There was a rebellion against duke Malcolm. 
We duck around shopping, get rations. 
Go to the town hall and the quest board is removed and it says to come inside. The guy is very nice and funny and confused etc and he says we gotta go kill goblins. 
We go the the village, Ayltan attempts to negotiate but Mivo decapitates a smalll goblin. We end up killing a village of children goblins and a single wolf named Barky.
Then a swarm of big goblins appears over the hills. They are astounded by the level of destruction.
