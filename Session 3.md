- We see the tower exploding and go to investigate. There is no panic and there is a blank gravestone in that space. People say it appeared from a long long time ago. 
- Harrow recognises us and he is very injured. He was passed out and has been awake for an hour. 
- When Harrow was told about the tower blowing up he looked really sick on the face.
- We go to the location of where the tower landed and there is a lady digging. She looks like an adventurer. We do not know her from earlier. 
- She says that it is her site and we need to back off. Rogue sneaks to her stuff and looks at it, nothing major, besides a small golden band. It is two golden leaves and the rogue takes the ring.
- The woman is Aziela and she used to be a historian. 
- We are 48105 PTHU and the remains are meant to be from 300 years ago. 
- Ayltan and Mivo (the bard) stay with the woman and the dig site and the rest of the party go to buy clothes for the pink halfling. 
- Find a weird dagger and cut my finger on it. Weird spiral handle with a skull being twisted. The woman says it’s the death dagger, it cannot be touched at all costs. The woman pulled some rags out of the pocket she put the stuff into earlier and grabbed the dagger under it. 
- The shopping party goes to a clothing store and a VERY eccentric storekeeper welcomes them and the store is very unusual. 
- The pink tiefling wants a pink beret and a pink bathrobe to wear. 
- The deep gnome and the green tiefling buy some bigger travelling cloaks to camouflage themselves on the streets. 
- The town to the south is called Eeston.
- Mivo sees someone watching us in the grass, while Ayltan is digging and talking with the lady. We then get jumped. And go into combat. Defeat 5, 3 run away. Woman is very brutal and casts some spell multiple times to kill the bandits. She said they have been on her ass for a while and she wanted to kill them. 
- Ayltan didn’t wanna kill any but he did anyway. The woman knows magic and uses swords as well, she asks why we were looking here.
- The ring that the rogue looted is magical with necromancy magic. 
- The rogue buys an explorer’s pack for the pink tiefling. 
- The party goes to a temple of Tyr and it’s boarded up and run down. They ask some guy why it’s closed. He says the cleric that ran it wasn’t devoted to Tyr but someone else, it was a couple of years ago, or not even that, a year ago. 
- They ask the man if someone will care if they go in, he says he doesn’t care.
- Inside is a massive stone statue of Tyr. The pink tiefling starts praying to the statue and Spert speaks from inside the statue. 
- He’s underneath the statue and says there is a trapdoor at the back. 
- There is an ornate chest with Spert on top of it, glowing in blue sparkles. He says he is stuck to the chest and cannot move. 
- Bog comes back to us, mentions Gawin and Aziela throws the dagger down, along with an identical one she had. She then gets very defensive, wants to attack Bog, and when Ayltan tells her he touched the daggers she tells him to run as far as he can and stop putting others in danger.
- We sleep the woman, tie her and confiscate her weapons and focus.
- As she wakes up, the air is getting colder and everything is blacker. Gawyn then appears, everything in skulls, some amulet with black and green. Azela is frozen in fear as she sees him.
- He says we will all die, and fires a green blast at Ayltan, which straight up kills him. Then the same happens with Mivo, then Azela dies, just Bog is alive.
- Just before he kills her, He says he knows Azela, she says he doesn’t know her. He calls her the fiend slayer. 
- Gawyn talks to Bog and tries to figure out why he won’t die. He then brings us back. The woman is terrified of Bog. She is very taken aback by the situation and we don’t care.
- Back to Spert, he is still on the chest. But the trapdoor no longer exists into the room. He’s been 3 days in this room.
- The woman is running after us and we all head back to Limepass. No one is phased by anything, almost as if it didn’t happen.
- We try to find the party and go into the temple of Tyr. 
- We have a conversation through the trapdoor, and we try to open it, as soon as I touch the handle, and we roll initiative.
